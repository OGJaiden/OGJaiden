Hey! I'm Jaiden, also known as OGJaiden in the FiveM community. I've been deeply involved in UI scripting and EUP development for seven years, bringing creative and functional designs to life. At just 17 years old, Iâ€™ve worked with some of the top FiveM servers, including GBGRP, IRP, TWRP, PRP, RRP, BRRP, CLRP, RBRP, and DRP.

Beyond FiveM development, I also have experience in HTML and website development, allowing me to create and customize web-based solutions for communities and projects. I've also taken on staff roles in many of the servers Iâ€™ve worked with, helping manage and improve communities with my expertise.

If you're looking for custom UI work, EUP development, website creation, or general FiveM enhancements, Iâ€™m always open to new projects!
